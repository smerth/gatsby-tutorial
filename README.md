# Blog site built with gatsby.js

This site was built following the tutorial from the [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) site.

In the tutorial you build three sites. This site was built from part four of the tutorial but then I went on to incorporate elements from parts 1-3. I addition I added a PDF library after reading [This](http://blog.blakesimpson.co.uk/view/96-building-a-pdf-library-with-gatsby-js) blog post from Blake Simpson (which is very good!)

The site is based on: `gatsby-starter-hello-world`
